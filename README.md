# ML_Framework
General framework for building Machine Learning models with SKLearn and Deep Learning models in PyTorch.

1March2023 - Harman Casey

Included three python files showing a sample implementation of a data generation, model, and training loop in script format. This can be run from the command line like an executable. More "production ready" in some aspects. 

Rest of the files are jupyter notebooks. These included frameworks for Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest Classifier Machine Learning Algorithms, as well as Artificial Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network, and Auto-Encoder Deep Neural Networks. These are only meant to be guides on how to setup the data -> model -> implementation pipeline and will require changes depending on data structure, type, etc. Some key elements included the methods for one-hot encoding data, dataset construction and piping into the PyTorch framework, model class design, and various methods for model testing and validation.
